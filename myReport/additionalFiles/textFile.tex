%% ABOUT

This toolset is to be used while programming in MATLAB to create a report or paper of any
kind with the data from MATLAB, so it bridges the way and saves you the time to coppy
values and make pretty tables and plots through an additional LaTeX editor. Please follow the
upcoming instructions to get it up and running.

%% SETUP1

To set the LaTeX Generator up, you will need the following installed on your pc :

%% SETUP2

After installing these components, copy the reportGenerator main folder to a secure location
on your machine and be sure to add it to your MATLABs search path so you can work from
a different directory and use all the functions without restriction. To be sure that everything
is set up correctly, we have provided a very simple "hello world" programme that you can run
and check if it generates a pdf document with "hello world" on one page, in your current working
directory.

%% HOWIW

In this section we will talk about all the different files that you can use and manipulate to 
get the best out of this toolset. The main files that you are gonna be changing are :

\begin{description}
\item[{\tt setting.dat}] Specifies a variaty of settings for the program which can be adjusted 
to your specific needs.
\item{{\tt myTextBlocks.tex}} A file which contains blocks of Latex code 
separated by lines with {\tt \%\% TAG} where {\tt TAG} is a unique identifier.
\item[{\tt myCodeBlocks.m}] A file which contains blocks of MATLAB code 
separated by lines with {\tt \%\% TAG} where {\tt TAG} is a unique identifier.
It can be used to evaluate code specified in a section of this file.
\item[{\tt myMatlabInit.m}] This is a init-File for MATLAB which is executed 
at the beginning. One can specify all necessarey settings there.
\end{description}

You can also specify files with different names for organisation purposes, if that's the case
you will have to change the file names in the {\tt setting.dat} file.
Additionally you will need to edit the provided MATLAB {\tt startup.m} file and set the \LaTeX{} 
install path to the path on your computer.



%% TEXINTRO

Now we will go through the functions available and show you what you can do with them, you can
use this documentation and the MATLAB file {\tt reportingDocu.m} with which it was created, to 
help you write your own reports. All of the functions that will be mentioned also have 
descriptions which can be accessed through MATLAB by using the $help$ command fot the function
in question.

%% NEWREPORT1

To use the following functions you will need to create a $latexGenerator$ object which will be used
to access the methods provided and explained in the following sections. This can be easily done with:

%% NEWREPORT2

Note that the constructor function also takes in parameters with which we could like in the following example 
change the name of the settings file we are using, this can be very useful if we have a settings file with 
settings that fit our current needs but we might use a different settings file usually.


%% SETGET1

Using the $set$ and $get$ methods from the reportGenerator super class, we can access and change the
settings provided by the {\tt setting.dat} file from withing our MATLAB code. For example, if we wanted 
to change the name the program gives to the graphics it saves, we could use the following code : 

%% SETGET2

With this piece of code we set the name prefix of the plots that are being saved to 'plot\_'. 
It can be utilyzed to set and get, with the get function, all of the parameters in {\tt setting.dat}.

%% TITLETOC

Like in the most cases we would want to add a title page to our document, we will do this in the following
lines of code. The title, author and date will be displayed with the corresponding settings from the 
setting file. We can also add a table of contents.

%% PARAGRAPH

All of these paragraphs in this documentation were added using the paragraph function, you can choose if you
want to add the paragraph by writing it whole as a string in MATLAB and passing it to the function or using
the {\tt myTextBlocks.tex} file from which we can import any latex code or text and use it in our documents 
just by passing the {\tt TAG} to the paragraph function. 
An example for adding a short sentence would be : 

%% HEADINGS

Using one of these heading types we can structure our document much better and provide a better overview, since
without them, the table of contents would be useless. The following code was used to create the heading for this
current section in this document :

%% LISTSENV

We can see that it is fairly easy and quick to add a MATLAB cell array of strings and make a pretty list in 
your document. The following examples show that nested lists are also possible, the code that was used to make these 
can be found in the {\tt reportDocu.m} file under LISTS. 

%% TABTAB

Tables can be created directly from MATLAB arrays, following example shows a simple table containing the values 
from an array with random values. The following code was executed.

%% TABTAB2

All of the settings for the tables can be adjusted in the {\tt setting.dat} file or through the {\tt set} 
function as we will see in this section. Now we will demonstrate how to lable the rows and columns. We will
do that by specifying the row and/or column labels as strings with collon separated labels as we can se in 
the following code. 

%%  TABTAB3

The following example shows that we can also pass data with Not a Number fields, the corresponding parameter 
in the {\tt setting.dat} file has to be set appropriate, by default it is set to {\tt nan}. We will also demonstrate 
how {\tt booktabs} and {\tt formating} for a new table.
